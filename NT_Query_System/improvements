Firstly, when we input a statement of the type <P, is, a, Ns, Ns> where the first Ns can also be an Adjective for example: John is a purple duck. It will recognise purple as the color (Noun) and will skip the next noun. In order to overcome this problem we can add a checker inside statements.process_statement().
Another problem is that we do not distinguish between 'an' and 'a' for nouns.
Also, another improvement we can make is in verb_stem and noun_stem. Our current rules for verb_stem consider the simple verb construction "stem" + "3s' part", but does not consider if the verb is constructed by "prefix" + "stem" + "sufix" + "3s' part", thus skipping words like unties. For noun_stem we do not have enough rules to cover words that in singular form end in "oe" like canoe, shoe, foe, thus using them as cano,sho,fo.
Last improvement we can make is to extend our grammar to cover statements including "and".
